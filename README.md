# Flocking   
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5440199/59597017-efe7d200-914c-11e9-9023-3f3931eaec62.PNG" width="90%"></img>   
This p5js project demonstrates flocking, which is a behaviour that many animals express.   
It consists of alignment, cohesion, and separation. I have also added an external force which repels the boids away from the mouse.  
Click to add new boids to the screen.   
The base code was made by following a tutorial by The Coding Train.   


# How to Run
Download all files as a ZIP.  
Extract files into the same folder.  
Open the index.html file.

# Future Goals
Add 3D   
Different coloured boids   
Boids with different behaviours   
Let external force be attractive as well as repulsive
