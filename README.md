# Flocking
This p5js project demonstrates flocking, which is a behaviour that many animals express. It consists of alignment, cohesion,
and separation. I have also added an external force which repels the boids away from the mouse.
Personal project developed by following a tutorial by The Coding Train.   


# How to Run
Download all files as a ZIP.  
Extract files into the same folder.  
Open the index.html file.

# Future Goals
Add 3D   
Different coloured boids   
Boids with different behaviours   
Let external force be attractive as well as repulsive
